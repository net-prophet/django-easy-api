Django Easy API allows you to quickly create power APIs for your project.

## Installation

TODO: Put this up on pypi

### Downloading File

Download the ScopingMixin file from github.
[ScopingMixin.py](http://github.com/net-prophet/django-easy-scoping/blob/master/DjangoEasyScoping/DjangoEasyScoping/ScopingMixin.py)

Import `ScopingMixin` and `ScopingQuerySet` from `ScopingMixin.py`.
```python
from <path to file>.ScopingMixin import ScopingMixin, ScopingQuerySet
```

### Using pip

`$ pip install django-easy-api`

Add `django-easy-api` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` dictionary in `settings.py`.
```python
from DjangoEasyScoping.ScopingMixin import ScopingMixin, ScopingQuerySet
```

### Implementing

Mix `ScopingMixin` in with the Django model(s) you'd like to create scopes for.
```python
class Purchase(ScopingMixin, models.Model):
```

Override the Queryset for that model using `ScopingQuerySet`.
```python
    objects = ScopingQuerySet.as_manager()
```

Done!

## Implementing with existing Managers/Querysets

If you'd like to continue using your own custom manager/queryset then you can! 
You only need to take action if you'd like to name the ScopingQuerySet override
something other than `objects`, for instance:

```python 
other_name = ScopingQuerySet.as_manager()
```

Then simply open `ScopingMixin.py` in your `sites-packages` and edit the following 
methods. 

```python
class ScopingMixin(object):

    @classmethod
    def get_scope(cls, name)
        if hasattr(cls, '__scopes__') and name in cls.scopes():
            return getattr(cls.objects.all(), name)

    @classmethod
    def get_aggregate(cls, name)
        if hasattr(cls, '__aggregate__') and name in cls.aggregates():
            return getattr(cls.objects.all(), name)
```
 becomes
```python
class ScopingMixin(object):

    @classmethod
    def get_scope(cls, name)
        if hasattr(cls, '__scopes__') and name in cls.scopes():
            return getattr(cls.other_name.all(), name)

    @classmethod
    def get_aggregate(cls, name)
        if hasattr(cls, '__aggregate__') and name in cls.aggregates():
            return getattr(cls.other_name.all(), name)
```
